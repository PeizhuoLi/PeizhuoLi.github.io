Furthermore, we propose neural blend shapes -- a set of corrective pose-dependent shapes that is used to address the notorious artifacts caused by standard rigging and skinning technique in joint region.","tags":null,"title":"Learning Skeletal Articulations with Neural Blend Shapes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kfir Aberman*","Peizhuo Li*","Dani Lischinski","Olga Sorkine-Hornung","Daniel Cohen-Or","Baoquan Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"11d7d92fd6b3c136219fb16a8141ae6b","permalink":"https://peizhuoli.github.io/publication/skeleton-aware/","publishdate":"1970-01-01T08:33:40+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/skeleton-aware/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a novel deep learning framework for data-driven motion retargeting between skeletons, which may have different structure, yet corresponding to homeomorphic graphs.
